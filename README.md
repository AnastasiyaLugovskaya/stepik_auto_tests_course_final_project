# stepik_auto_tests_course_final_project

This is a comprehensive test project created from scratch as part of the course at Stepik (https://stepik.org/course/575/syllabus). The project adheres to the Page Object Model (POM) standards and makes use of Pytest and Selenium frameworks.

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate a full-fledged test framework developed to implement the learnings obtained from the Stepik course. It follows the best practices of the Page Object Model (POM) to ensure maintainability, readability and reusability of the test code. The test suite was built using Pytest, a mature and widely-used testing framework for Python, and Selenium, a powerful tool for web application testing.

## Features

- Utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) for structuring and maintaining the test code
- Leverages Pytest for efficient test discovery and execution
- Integrates Selenium to automate interactions with the web application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed
3. Run the test suite using Pytest
4. View the test results and reports to assess the application's behavior
